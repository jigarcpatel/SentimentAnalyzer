      "pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . \n",
      "the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . \n",
      "holden caulfield did it better . \n",
      "the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . \n",
      "you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . \n",
      "for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . \n",
      "you wo n't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . \n",
      "this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . \n",
      "sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . \n",
      "it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so \n",
      "it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . \n",
      "characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . \n",
      "rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . \n",
      "the lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it . \n",
      "try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' \n",
      "there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . \n",
      "all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . \n",
      "it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . \n",
      "it ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . \n",
      "it 's like watching a nightmare made flesh . \n",
      "the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . \n",
      "its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . \n",
      "i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . \n",
      "jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . \n",
      "instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . \n",
      "if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt . \n",
      "outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . \n",
      "i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy . \n",
      "with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . \n",
      "even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller 's hand often feels unsure . \n",
      "a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground \n",
      "care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . \n",
      "moretti 's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . \n",
      "it 's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . \n",
      "it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . \n",
      "although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . \n",
      "the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . \n",
      "every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . \n",
      "all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that . \n",
      "vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . \n",
      "burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . \n",
      "the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . \n",
      "in all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . \n",
      "once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . \n",
      "no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . \n",
      "whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . \n",
      "it 's everything you do n't go to the movies for . \n",
      "velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . \n",
      "this is n't even madonna 's swept away . \n",

      "this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . \n",
      "the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . \n",
      "manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . \n",
      "an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . \n",

      "hilariously inept and ridiculous . \n",
      "what better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ? \n",
      "` de niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . ' \n",
      "instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . \n",
      "corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . \n",
      "nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . \n",

      "a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . \n",

      "a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . \n",
      "not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . \n",
      "on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . \n",

      "writer/director joe carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . \n",
      "a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . \n",
      "this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . \n",
      "it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . \n",

I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working.

If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.\n",

It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.\n",

I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.\n",

It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.\n",

The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear.\n",

      "Review: It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of \"real life\" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a \"good enough\" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.\n",

Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.\n",

What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is \"Buyer beware\"\n",

This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than \"Ooh, big robots and explosions!\" But hey, for some, that's really all you need.\n",

He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters.

Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores.\n",

      "Review: The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in \"The Godfather\" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you.\n",

Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise.

In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged.

Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like \"all the others.\" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!\n",

A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days.

Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman.

Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed.

Shooter Jenning's \"Silver Tongue Devil and I\" is amazing. Willie Nelson's \"The Legend\" is as great or if not better then the Highwaymen version. The version on \"Why Me\" is also a worthy tribute. The problem i had with the CD was when i heard Russell Crowe's \"Darby's Castle\" cause it was a horrible redition where Russell Crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by Kristofferson and Dylan. Then i heard the awful Brian Mcknight atrocity \"Me and Bobby Magee\" which was just Mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible R&B redition. I had never heard a bad version of \"Me and Bobby Magee\" until this CD. I don't know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged.\n",

There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published.\n",

Yet, the transfer onto DVD is the worst I've even seen, the opening titles are blurry, the picture fuzzy. One review questioned that it may have came from the master VHS. I would not even go that far, it's a very poor copy, as for the sound, if you have 5.1 surround, you'll hear music and the voices coming from all directions. I view my movies on a HDTV, and that's even no help. As for extras, there are none, not even a trailer. So should you get it?

That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake.

I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books.\n",

I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song \"Any Dream Will Do\" to the BEGINNING of the show.\n",

However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled \"The Sacred And The Profane\", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message.\n",

I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.\n",

      "Review: This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months, after the first one broke after 5 weeks. This one worked wonderfully for about 4 weeks until one morning. I came in and found coffee all over the counter. I thought I had not aligned the pot properly or something. After another week of dealing with this, the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills. This coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day. I don't know what happened and we couldn't get it resolved. We purchased a Cuisinart with a 3 yr warranty (not the one that grinds coffee) and has worked great for 6 weeks.\n",

      "Review: This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's \"Prose Edda\", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture.\n",

For his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist. He is vilified and demonized. He refuses to accept that the health of South Africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour, not poverty and underdevelopment. He opposes pushing toxic drugs on pregnant woman and their babies. This honest and hard working leader deserves recognition.

(...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption.\"3) The morality of Darwinism:\"The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and \"not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us.\"1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion.

No where in the book does MS Nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog. To her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts. Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another. Her biggest inside tip under the chapter \"Tricks of the Trade\" was \"Keep your nose clean, your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed until you know what it is all about.\" Good advice since you won't learn what showing your own dog is about from this source.\n",

For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon.

Eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer, Just like garion. Eragon does magic in the same way Garion does, through \"The will and the word\".I could go on and on. I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven't read Edding's masterpiece. One of the only resons his book sold so well was because he was so young when he started writing it.Also, the dialogue is stupid, and it is obvious that he tries to make his writing sound impressive through flowery writing style.\n",

Then the \"menu\" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned \"off.\" The only way to avoid this is to choose \"other\" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues?\n",

The only one he ever had anything to do with was the orginal. Which by the way is by far the best of the bunch. I don't really even count the others at all. Well, maybe the second one, it wasn't too bad.As for this movie, I'll be honest I've never even watched it. I guess I'll rent it someday and see what it's all about. At least it doesn't have Michael Myers in it, which is good, cause in my opinion he died after the second movie. I do think they should of changed the name of this though. I mean, every Halloween movie has had a different director, naming this one part III doesn't even make any sense at all.\n",

      "Review: As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous.\n",

The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year...\n",

These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in 14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner.

Some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the United States in a more positive light.

It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect.

A western full of colorful characters set during the days prior to the Civil War with glorious names (e.g; Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer, J.E.B Stuart, John Brown, etc.) from our American history. However, the tape transfer is horrible. It's grainy and dark in some scenes. It's hard to watch.

Needed a second one, but when it arrived I discovered a manufacturing error - the rear bottom pads were the same ones as on the front; they are supposed to be thicker than the front ones, so as to slightly elevate the rear so it doesn't wobble on the center screw. You can even see it in the photos on amazon.com So with the same pads front and rear, the pad is worthless as it doesn't sit level, it sits on the center screw and wobbles!Tried getting the correct pads directly from Targus, they said to return it to the vendor. Amazon was nice enough to quickly send a replacement -- with the same problem.Two tries is enough for me, off to Best Buy instead...\n",

So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one, or buy a new one and return the broken one. Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same, they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I got it. It was improved. Now it doesn't die outright. The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart. And to get warranty service, you have to pay to ship it back to them.

All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully. Transferring albums was equally easy, although I only did one. In both cases, the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use, however, the CD player would only play part of a CD--three songs--and then it would quit, locking up the unit. Powering off and back on freed up the unit, but didn't solve the problem. We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund.

Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition.

However, it lacks the much more practical details in explaning what the techo-fundamental method he used is all about. The book did provide some basic advice on implementing stop-loss, limit buy, etc, to limit the risk. However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading 101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks. This book is good if you are looking for a non-textbook leisure reading.

The hiss that is present during and between songs is unbelievable. It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape. I am blessed to own the MFSL version which I assume is still the gold standard of this c.d..I purchased this edition on a lark because it was touted that \"you won't believe it's the same c.d.\". Well, they were right but for the wrong reason. This is a 10 star title that deserves better.\n",

      "Review: I have to agree with the others who warn that this book is unsuitable for children. In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did. Based on my first-hand experience of how this book reads from the perspective of a child, I wholeheartedly advise parents not to subject their children to it. There are better choices.\n",

The new lid, which screws into the mug, does not permit an adequate flow of the coffee when it is in the open position. Drinking it while I drove my car, I had to literally lean my head back and use gravity to get enough coffee to come out. That lead to the coffee leaking onto my shirt (which I should have seen coming). I tried to loosen the screw on the bottom of the lid as others mentioned, but I still can't get enough coffee to come out of it when it's in the open position. I don't have the same problems with it leaking that some others have mentioned, but that just tells me that this is an inconsistent, poorly made product.\n",

(1) Grady Sutton, who doesn't get nearly enough lines or screen time; (2) the quartet singing \"Snow\" in the dining car of the train; (3) the outfit Rosemary Clooney is wearing when she gets on the train as she \"runs\" away from Bing Crosby; and (4) Bing Crosby's apparent self-consciousness as he is undressing in front of Danny Kaye while being talked into following the girls (watch for it -- he hurriedly pulls his shirt down so the camera won't reveal the fact that he's wearing briefs!!!).

Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap.

They are always well produced but never over produced. This however is unlike anything else they have released. It is an awkward beginning at best. The songs show promise and that promise was realized in their subsequent releases. Where the performances are solid, the production sinks the recording. It is dated, slick and just a poor fit for the band's sound. If you must have them all, you will end up buying this. Otherwise, get any of the other releases they are far superior and all terrific. This is just not an essential recording.\n",

I was pondering on whether I would buy it while I bobbed my head to the music video for \"Margarita\" because I liked that song a lot. But while I listened to the album, I noticed that it remained even throughout. There was never a bad song or a really great song. It was at a steady pace the entire time, sort of like listening to Sade or someone of that nature. When \"Underwater Love\" came on, I was pleasantly surprised that he did have one head bobber that made me want to dance, but other than that, the album was at a medium pace. I don't love it. I don't hate it. I'm just indifferent about it. I would replay \"Underwater Love\" in heavy rotation, but I'm not sure I'll buy it.\n",

I don't think it should be part of standard curriculum, just as I don't think Fahrenheit 451 should be. Huxley and Bradbury's bursting desire to make the world aware of the disorienting menace of media and information control is wasted on adolescents.The book IS thought-provoking, though I wish it had been a short story. As such it would never as been as popular: the characters ARE interesting, but Huxley relies upon THEM to explain everything.

The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun. Basically this movie got some good hype early on, and has been too ARTSY for anyone to disagree. Not a waste of money, but not nearly as fresh or clever or new as it would like to be. A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources. If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed.\n",

No tracks stand out, although I'm sure 'Girlfriend' will get some airplay when the album gets a full release.

Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing.

She quickly learned to climb on and off and go forwards and backwards and loved her bike. The steering was a little stiff and took a while for her to get the hang of it.As spring came we moved outdoors and she got better at steering. She grew so I moved the seat to the second setting. Now, at 18-20 months, the bike isn't so great -- when she tries to go forward, the back of her feet hit those rear wheels - every time! I've tried every height setting on the seat and it doesn't make a difference. She always wants to ride her bike, but gives up after just a few feet - who would want their feet to get hit all the time! The rear wheels are just a few inches too close to the seat.We will be looking for a replacement. Disappointing.\n",

In my opinion, the European version is the best. It certainly has a lot more violence but it made the movie much clearer with Ford's narration and the happy ending that made the film less depressing than it already is. Sadly the DVD lacks all this offering us the director's vision only. Strangely the Criterion Edition LD(which offers the European version)has not made it to the DVD. This is sad considering that Ridley Scott's Legend is given a better treatment on DVD offering two versions of the film in a Collector's Edition(the fantastic director's cut and the horrible U.S version). Hopefully, Bladerunner will be rereleased with both European version and director's cut in the near future(and possibly a 'making of' documentary as well).\n",

Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.I guess what you see isn't always what you get. I'm sure the actual movie is fine. I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches. Maybe I should check that, too!Follow-up Review:Judy in Customer Service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of Grease in a leather jacket for me and I could send them back the old one in exchange. She was very kind and I give her Kudos for being so involved. As promised, I got my Grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift! I would give this 5 stars now, but it wouldn't let me change it.\n",

      "Review: So I got this as a christmas gift one year and was very happy with it. It's a great mp3 player with a good navigation menu (much better than a sansa or an iPod), good features, and great sound quality. It was all I just perfect for about the first year. Thats when the problems started. One day it froze up, but I reset it, no problem. About two months later it froze again. And again. And again. And again. Lately it won't even turn on long enough to hit the play button before it freezes. As one could imagine, it's completely useless now. I'm looking into replacing it with either a Sony Walkman or a Creative Zen (the new one, not a Zen V) and I hope whatever I decide on will be more reliable. Overall, I would not suggest this to anyone, because even though it seems great, the reliability of the software leaves something to be desired.\n",

The frustration you feel on behalf of the lead Kaylie is every woman's nightmare of feeling trapped and helpless in a situation you have no control over. She is accosted in her own home by the zealous bounty hunter Sam McKade, mistaken to be her twin sister, molested when she claims she is NOT the one, and then dragged across the country against her will. The fact that Sam is supposed to be a professional only makes Kaylie's plight worse in that he doesn't do anything conclusive to find out if she's really who she says she is.

In fact, Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser, later work. Disc Two, the live portion, is a nice show but it's a shame for Pixies fans to have to shell out extra cash for the accompanying 'best of' CD just to get it.I give it two stars because the music is good, but the arrangement is not.

Atwood delivers with her novel a new aspect in the various dystopias of the 20th century: the tyranny of a fundamental christian sect.Considering all these aspects one could remark that the artistic realization leaves a lot to be desired.But the final question,if the handmaid's tale is really worth reading is difficult to answer.If you are interested in becoming acquainted with dystopian novels you will be more content with one of the classic dystopias, such as Orwell's \"1984\" or Huxley's \"Brave New World\".\n",

I'd be left with a lid slightly immersed in the can's contents and attached by a small strand of metal. I'd then have to get a small knife or fork to pry the lid out of the can and was still left with the task of getting the lid off the can without cutting myself.Based on the other reviews I'm figuring I just got a dud, so I'll replace it with another OXO opener, but not this one.\n",

It was definately prior to the release of 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. The LP was originally to be a Japan only release, but bootleggers had already started taping all of the shows on the '76 Tour. It was released worldwide in an effort to \"Beat the boots\". Other boots of this tour have mostly the same track listing as 'On Stage', but occasionally have more or less 'Rising' tracks on them, depending on which leg of the tour they were on. You also must remember that these years were also the \"jam-happy\" years at concerts. Deep Purple songs were also kept in for fans of that Blackmore era of Purple. If you want a far more representative album of the tour try \"Live In Germany '76\", which I tend to enjoy better than this LP(CD)... and they probably were smoking something!\n",

It just made me want to read those books instead.There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid?Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things. I would have liked more of a \"fleshing out\" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me.\n",

      "Review: I love several of HG Wells novels. The First Men in the Moon, the War in the Air, the Time Machine are some of my favorite literary works. Unfortunately, many of his later works were full of Fabian Socialist Utopian ideas that essentially say if the stupid masses would just get out of the way and the \"right people\" were to make decisions for everyone, the world would be a great place. Of course, in novels, these people never want anything but the greater good. Of course, in reality, everyone who espouses these ideals, such as the aforementioned Soros, really want wealth and power for themselves. As a result, this is a simpleminded and boring approach to a future history novel. If it weren't written by HG Wells, probably no one would pick it up. While the movie made from this book, \"Things to Come\", is worth watching, don't waste your time with this preachy and silly book.\n",

      "Review: In \"The Greengage Summer\" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.\n",

Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as \"Discontinued\". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store.

      "Review: Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk.\n",

      "Review: Rating this one is difficult. The rich symbolism of Tarot was forever impacted by the Order of the Golden Dawn, and A.E. Waite's \"Pictorial Key\" is a glimpse into that symbolism. Readers with a serious interest in occult Tarot will find this an essential text. Waite, though, considered himself bound by vows of secrecy, and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the \"uninitiated\" astray, so reading critically is a must. To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore. However, modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the Waite-Smith deck design; to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today (frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of), this book is absolutely necessary. It won't be a fun read, but it *is* necessary\n",

I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.The plot in this movie doesn't matter much. No one cares about it. This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs. Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin. There's a whole variety of goofy humor. My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though. There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all. I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie.

It's the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future, and/or get you to start making worst-case-scenario plans in the event that \"all the wheels come off at once\".Especially interesting were the chapters on the history of \"mainstream\" and \"outsider\" churches in the US over the past two centuries (definitely a neglected topic, as the author points out) and the \"southernization\" of America. If Mr. Phillips' sterling credentials and decidedly non-left orientation aren't enough to convince you that this isn't a biased, one-sided polemic, you're probably unreachable.\n",

      "Review: Personally, I love everything Jane Austen ever wrote to BITS. But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat \"Northanger Abbey\") can match the high standards set by \"Pride and Prejudice\". There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line. This is still a great novel, as witty and funny as \"Pride and Prejudice\"--but it's comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste.\n",

Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had.\n",

      "Review: When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the \"Why\" in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it.\n",

Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots.

And then measuring, cleaning and throwing away...etc. Just a pain with a house full of kids running around so early in the morning!

THEN, we received an early holiday gift this morning, and lo and behold, the B70!!! Right out of the box and at the 3rd cup size (which is 9.25 oz.) the taste was AMAZING! And actually a bit stronger than the smaller sized cup from the B60. I'm not sure if it brews it a few seconds slower, but all-in-all definitely worth the extra $50 or so for this model over the B60.

Silk materials wear down very easily and the material can \"ball up\" creating those annoying lint balls. The last thing you want against your face are those things.Nylon/acrylic is more durable and feels just as silky smooth as real silk. They help you wick out the sweat and are easy to clean.I've sold balaclavas of different materials and find my customers overwhelmingly prefer the synthetic nylon/acrylic material.\n",

      "Review: Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good.\n",

It's a pity, too, because he's a good writer. It seems like, from time to time, writers write really great books and then get \"serious\" about their craft not realizing that the humor leavens the work and without it the writing pulls the reader down. This book puts people close and dear to Elvis in proximity to dangerous, evil people, subject matter much too grim for no smiles at all.\n",

When I want to hear him play this is what I put on.A lot of Cajun music is wedded to tradition, but Daigrepont feels free to experiment. \"Bebe de la Famille,\" for example, has a Caribbean touch. \"Bonjour, Dimanche,\" about a farmowner who's been up all night throwing a party and is listening to the countryside wake up at dawn, is the trickiest song here, simultaneously evoking the narrator's bleary state and the farmyard's early-morning bustle. Daigrepont is expanding the tradition, though, not leaving it behind. There's still bouncy party music like \"Tipitina Two-Step,\" a slow one about his uncle's store where you could speak Cajun French and gamble, and covers of songs by Canray Fontenot and Wade Fruge.All of Daigrepont's albums have good songs, but this one's something special. The worst you can say about anything here is that it's merely good.\n",

I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.\n",

Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture \"if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out.\" Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about.\n",

You just know that Dame Christie can spin a great yarn of intrigue, and this is no exception. Pocket Full of Rye beings with a dead body (with a pocket full of rye no less!) and suspects aplenty. As it turns out, almost everyone in the house had a reason for offing poor Mr. Fortescue. Then more murders occur, which by definition one would think would make the mystery easier to solve as there are less suspects. However, Ms. Christie is too clever for that, and much as in And Then There Were None, the reader is baffled until the very end.My only [small] complaint is that Miss Marple is a relatively small part of the novel, and it would have been nice to see a tad more of her.Relic113\n",

      "Review: Since I tend to steer away from thrillers in general, I am not likely to say I've seen this plot before, which appears to be the major criticism provided by most of the posters. My spouse is a huge SB fan, and we are catching up on her movies that we somehow missed, or those we want to see again. Bullock is convincing and riveting as a damaged cop. The two young boys are absolutely chilling. Ben Chaplin is adequate. My major problem is with the police department's eagerness to wrap up the case, and the way Cassie's boss treats her when she is not satisfied with the way the case is initially closed. If she is so bad at her job that her boss won't even recognize her instincts, why does he even keep her on the force? I found his treatment to be demeaning and unrealistic. Other than that, this was a fine Bullock movie (certainly better than most of her \"serious\" efforts), and I would call it a worthy addition to the genre.\n",

But I'm not into the ultra saggy, baggy look either. So, it's pretty damn impossible for me to buy a pair of jeans. Recently I bought a similar model to this one at local retailer and was very much impressed with the look and fit. As soon as I realized that after so long I had found a pair of jeans that met my needs I came to amazon to buy these. Son, I'm not disappoint. These jeans fit nicely. Very nice as a matter of fact. lots of leg room, nice inseam length, and nice fit from the waist to the end of your pockets. If you got yourself a small beer belly, I highly suggest buying one full size larger than you usually get. Otherwise, at least for me, these jeans are perfect.\n",

This book is about 2 people in their mid-thirties who fall in love against their wills. Its painful to read because of the depth of emotion, the heroine's relationship with her father and Mad Dog, as well as his relationship with his son, whom he doesn't know is related. Make any sense? ...Anyway, if I could go back in time I wouldn't have read this book.

You try using Ofoto or Shutterfly, but the uploading is pretty time-consuming as well and then you need to wait a week to get your prints. THIS THING IS THE ANSWER. It produces 4x6 prints quickly without even turning on your computer. The paper and the ink are sold bundled so you know the cost (29 cents/page) and the ink doesn't run out in the middle of a print job. I still have an Epson 2200 for printing larger prints, but this printer fills a real need in quickly and cheaply making prints to share with friends. Highly recommended.\n",
